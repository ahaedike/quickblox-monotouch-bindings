Monotouch binding of the QuickBlox iOS SDK v. 2.0.2
http://quickblox.com/developers/IOS#Download_iOS_SDK

NOTE:  This is a partial binding.  Text chat and Push Notifications have been implemented.

I am building a Xamarin project that uses QuickBlox.  I am binding to each feature as it is implemented.  So far, the binding for Chat and Push Notifications have been implemented and tested.  I will continue to update this project as we implement features.
